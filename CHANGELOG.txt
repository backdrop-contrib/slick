Slick 8.x-2.0-dev, 2016-03-28
-----------------------------
- #2693089: Add dependency on Blazy.
  Be sure to clear cache.
- Renamed visible_slides into visible_items to allow re-usable by Blazy.
- Changed thumbnail_hover option into thumbnail_effect to allow variant
  thumbnail stylings: hoverable, static grid.
- Moved Slick admin CSS into Blazy to re-use for a few related modules.
- Moved slick.media.js, slick.photobox.js, and all re-usable stuffs into Blazy.

Slick 8.x-2.0-dev, 2016-03-23
-----------------------------
- Made nice with ESLint.
- Recommended dependency on Blazy module to reduce DRY stuffs shared across
  Blazy, Mason, GridStack, Slick Views and Slick. Will require prior to Betas.
- Simplified slick-image.html.twig.
- Added entity_keys status to disable Default optionset.
- Fixed for Blazy integration.
- Renamed ::getSkinOptions() into ::getSkinsByGroupOptions() for clarity.
- Removed image dimensions fail safe, and moved most logic to ::getImage(), so
  using ::getImage() is a must than calling theme_slick_image() directly. This
  prevented loading image_style objects multiple times, and dup lines.
- Moved SlickFormatterTrait.php into FieldFormatter directory.
- Deleted SlickFormatterBase.php, and merged it into SlickFormatterTrait.php
- Moved aspect ratio fluid style attribute from JS into PHP, otherwise defeating
  the purpose to solve the layout reflow before the images are actually loaded.
- Moved SlickInterface.php into Entity.
