Slick Carousel
===============

Slick is a powerful and performant slideshow/carousel solution that works with
fields and Views, and supports enhancements for image, video, audio, and more
complex layouts.

Slick has a lot of options, please start with the very basic working samples
from the [Slick Extras](https://www.drupal.org/project/slick_extras) module.

* [Samples](https://www.drupal.org/project/slick_extras).
* [Demo](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

Features

* Fully responsive. Scales with its container.
* Uses CSS3 when available. Fully functional when not.
* Swipe enabled. Or disabled, if you prefer.
* Desktop mouse dragging.
* Fully accessible with arrow key navigation.
* Built-in lazyLoad, and multiple breakpoint options.
* Random, autoplay, pagers, etc...
* Works with Views, Image, Media or Field collection, or none of them.
* Supports text, responsive image/ picture, responsive iframe, video, and audio
  carousels with aspect ratio, see samples. No extra jQuery plugin FitVids is
  required. Just CSS.
* Exportable via CTools, or Features.
* Modular and extensible skins, e.g.: Fullscreen, Fullwidth, Split, Grid, or
  multiple-row carousel.
* Various slide layouts are built with CSS goodness.
* Nested sliders/ overlays, or multiple carousels, within a single Slick.
* Multimedia lightboxes, or inline multimedia.
* Media switcher: linked to content, iframe, lightboxes: Colorbox, Photobox,
  PhotoSwipe.
* Cacheability + lazyload = light + fast.
* Navigation/ pager options:
  - thumbnails
  - arrows
  - dots, comes with different flavors: circle dots, dots as static grid
    thumbnails, and dots with hoverable thumbnails
  - text/tabs, provide Thumbnail caption, and leave Thumbnail style/image empty
